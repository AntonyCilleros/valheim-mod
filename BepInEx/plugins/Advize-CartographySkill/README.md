## Description
Ever sailed past a visible coastline, but it didn't appear on your world map? That's because the default radius around the player that is uncovered on the world map is smaller than your view distance! This mod allows you to increase that explore radius over time as you uncover more of your map.

This mod also includes a craftable spyglass item that doubles as a weapon. Use it to bash your enemies or to see their cowardly faces up close... but from a safe distance! Uses custom mesh, textures, and logic.

The custom skill as well as the spyglass can be enabled/disabled via the mod's config file, generated after the mod is loaded at least once (see Config & Other Info below).

Crafted and upgraded at a workbench. By default, right click will zoom in. Hold left shift and press right click to decrease zoom level by 1. Optional third key can be set to fully zoom out, or press 'r' to sheathe your Spyglass. Controls and functionality are configurable.

Recipe is: 2x Obsidian, 2x Bronze, 1x Crystal

Alternatively, you can spawn the item with command `spawn AdvizeSpyglass`

## Installing

### Manual Install

Extract the Advize_CartographySkill.dll file into your BepinEx/plugins folder.
Directory structure should look like this:
```
BepInEx ->
    plugins ->
        Advize_CartographySkill.dll
```
## Contact Author
You can reach me on the Nexus to provide bug reports or feedback https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/394

## Config and Other Info:
Mod is highly configurable, a config file will be generated after first loading the mod and can be found in ï»¿BepInEx/config/advize.CartographySkill.cfg

Localization Support: A file named Advize_CartographySkill.json will be generated alongside the .dll file after the game is first launched. In it you will find the ability to change the Spyglass name and description text. Any changes made to this file will be loaded by the mod.

Note: Configuration settings will sync to clients from the server provided the server is running the mod as well.

This config can be edited out of game with a text editor, or modified in game using the Configuration Manager mod (recommended).
By default, one should be able to reach cartography level 100 before exploring an entire world; but it will not add xp for parts you've already discovered (yet). If you need to increase the level higher and you've discovered your whole world, you'll need to uncover parts of the map in a new world.

Controls can be changed in the mod config - use this as your guide: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
