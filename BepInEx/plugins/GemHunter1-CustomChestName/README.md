This mod lets you rename the tooltip name of chests to make the organizing easier.

The character limit is 32.

# Usage
To rename a chest you first need to equip any tool like a hammer and then put it on your belt (hide weapon, default button R).
After that, you will be able to see the prompt to rename the chest with Shift+E.

# Installation
This mod depends on BepInEx for Valheim.
Use Vortex or you can install the mod manually by copying its .dll file into your Valheim/BepInEx/plugins folder.

# Server compatibility
Works with any server, even if the server doesn't have the mod installed. However, any client who wants to see/change the custom name needs to have the mod ofc.

# Mod compatibility
Depending on mod it may work with custom chests.
