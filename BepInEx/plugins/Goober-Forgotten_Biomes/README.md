# Forgotten_Biomes

Add some variety in AshLands and DeepNorth biomes
Re-enable the old Mistlands look

## Features

- AshLands and Ashrain will burn if you not in water or have very good fire resist.
- AshLands/Ashrain damage trigger to enable/disable it
- Configurable damage value (Default 10% of your health)
- AshLands have Rocks, Ore, etc.. (Configurable)
- DeepNorth have Rock, Ore, etc.. (Configurable)
- Add Vegetation/rock to all biomes (Configurable)
- Add Location, Tower, Ruin etc.. to all biomes. Some have monsters !  (Configurable)

## DISCLAIMER
Enable every options led to an increased World Generation time, be prepared.
On Server this will increase the packet size.


##WHY ?
Valheim come with a lot of Structure not fully implemented in game, but still available in code.
I just want to re-enable everything and let player choose if it's useful or not;
You can customize biome vegetation and rocks, choose to add more and more things in every biomes.

Ashlands and DeepNorth were empty. now you have (by default) a real biome, with rocks, veins etc..

With addition of Disabled and Hidden Locations, you can try what the dev didn't showed.
Stone tower, Castle, old Pillar, some location are broken, some may collapse when you come closer.
This mod add more diversity in your world.

So now Valheim is a real Old World with fallen realms. And you can customize YOUR VALHEIM !
