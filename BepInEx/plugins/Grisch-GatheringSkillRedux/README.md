# GatheringSkillRedux
This is a rewrite/refactor/update of Pipakin's GatheringSkill Mod for Valheim.

- Original mod: https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/pipakin/GatheringSkill/
- Original repo: https://github.com/pipakin/PipakinsMods/tree/master/GatheringSkillMod

Changelog:
- 1.0.0 First upload
- 1.0.1 Removed console debug spam
- 1.0.2 I'm an idiot
- 1.0.3 Updated Readme
- 1.0.4 Forgot, wasn't important
- 1.0.5 Saw more console spam. Removed.
- 1.0.6 Fixed an error in the default configs. Apparently "BlueBerryBush" isn't the same as "BlueberryBush".. So if the mod was ignoring blueberries it should stop. (Thanks to "Typical Politician" for reporting the bug)

Recommend either deleting your configs, or making sure that "BlueberryBush" is spelled correctly in the list.

### Licence

As far as I'm concerned this code belongs to Pipakin who created the original mod. I've sent a message asking if he minds if I update his mod but have not gotten a response. If Pipakin, as the original creator wants to take ownership of this code he's more than welcome. In the meantime I'll continue to maintain it as best I can.
