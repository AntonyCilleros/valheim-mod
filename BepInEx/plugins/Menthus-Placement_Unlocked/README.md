# Placement Unlocked for Valheim

Allows campfires, cooking stations, cauldrons, bonefires, hearths, smelters, blast furnaces, charcoal kilns, and windmills to be placed on wooden structures.

Vanilla Valheim prevents several different items from being constructed on wood. This mod aims to remove that restriction.

The list of items that can be placed on wood are listed below:
Campire
Bonefire
Hearth
Smelter
Blast Furnace
Charcoal Kiln
Windmill

Note: Placement of the Windmill is a little wonky because of the way it's colliders are set up.

## Installation (manual):
Place the PlacementUnlocked folder into the Valheim\BepInEx\plugins folder.
