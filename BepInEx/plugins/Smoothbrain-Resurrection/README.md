# Resurrection

Your so called friends die a lot and you have to spend more time waiting for them to return than actually playing the game?

Just open a portal to hell (thanks, Azu) and drag them back into the world of the living. For a price (default: 1x Surtling Core), of course ...

Clear the item name in the config, to make resurrections free.

Also has an option, to allow the resurrection of other group members only, which requires the [Groups](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/Groups) mod to be installed.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.
