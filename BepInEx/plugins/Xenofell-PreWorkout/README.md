# PreWorkout

Ever thought it was a bit silly that you were strongest after devouring a full meal in Valheim rather than an hour or two later? This mod removes the food degradation so you retain the food bonuses right until the moment the food expires.

# Installation

1. Install BepInEx.
2. Extract the mod download into <Valheim>/BepInEx/plugins folder so the .dll is inside of the plugins folder.
3. BepInEx will load the plugin and all should work. Enjoy!
